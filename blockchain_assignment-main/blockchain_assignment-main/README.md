# Blockchain Technologies Assignment: Implementing a Basic Blockchain with Merkle Tree                                                                
**Group:** IT-2103                                                                       

# 1. Investigate Blockchain Principles

"Blockchain is a distributed decentralized peer-to-peer network to facilitate transactions between participants that are not only secure but also transparent, immutable, and traceable" (Ali et al., 2020).               

**Blockchain principles are:** Decentralization, Integrity, Security, Privace, Inclusive.                                                                
**Blockchain key working mechanisms:** Distributed Ledger, Cryptographic Hash Functions, Consensus Mechanisms (PoW, PoS), Transactions, Block creation and verification etc.

# 3.1 Define Blockchain Structure 
Blockchain consists of blocks. Every block in header has metadata: Previous Hash, Timestamp, Nonce, Merkle Root. Also it has transactions which include: ID, Sender Address, Receiver Address and Amount.                
Also Blockchain includes: chain, consensus mechanism, network, genesis block, cryptographic hashing and smart contracts (optional)
The project was written in Python; the structure of the project consists of four classes: Block, Blockchain, Merkle node and Merkle tree. Each member contributed equally and was able to be helpful in creating the project                                          
**Libraries used:** time (allows to work with time in Python), hashlib (provides a suite of functions for hashing data).                                               
**Interface:** command line (4 actions).
# 3.9 Final Review
The blockchain project was executed with precision and teamwork, resulting in a well-structured and functional implementation. The project was developed using Python and was organized into four essential classes: Block, Blockchain, Merkle Node, and Merkle Tree. Each team member made significant contributions, demonstrating a balanced and collaborative effort throughout the project's development.

**Key Components:**
Classes: The project architecture was well-thought-out, utilizing essential classes for blocks, the blockchain itself, and Merkle trees and nodes. This modular approach enhances readability and maintainability.
Equal Contribution: Every team member actively participated and contributed equally, fostering a cooperative environment that facilitated the project's success.
**Libraries and Tools:**
Libraries: The project effectively utilized Python libraries such as time for time-related functions and hashlib for robust data hashing. These libraries streamlined the implementation of core functionalities.
Interface: The user interface was implemented through the command line, offering users four fundamental actions. This simplicity in interaction ensures ease of use for end-users.
**Strengths:**
**Modularity:** The project's use of classes and modular design showcases a strong understanding of object-oriented programming principles, enhancing the code's readability and maintainability.
**Collaboration:** Team members' equal contributions and effective collaboration played a pivotal role in the project's success, reflecting strong teamwork and communication skills.
**Areas of Improvement:**
**Documentation:** While the implementation is robust, enhancing documentation, including inline comments and comprehensive README files, could further improve the project's accessibility and ease of understanding for future developers and users.
**User Experience:** Consideration of a graphical user interface (GUI) in addition to the command line could enhance the user experience, making the blockchain accessible to a wider audience.
**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the project exemplifies a collaborative and well-structured approach to blockchain development. With a strong foundation in Python programming, effective use of libraries, and a clear command line interface, the project demonstrates technical proficiency and teamwork. By addressing documentation and user experience considerations, the project could reach an even broader audience, ensuring its impact and usability in the blockchain community.
Note: The project's successful implementation and collaborative spirit are commendable. Addressing documentation and user experience aspects would further enhance its accessibility and usability.
